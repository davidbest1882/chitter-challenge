WEEK 4 Friday Challenge: To create a Chitter app with the following 4 user stories:

STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

I completed the first 3 users stories but have not finished the forth yet.
Users are able to sign up but their names are not posted with the message yet.

To download and run the app:
$ git clone https://github.com/davidbest1882/chitter-challenge.git
$ cd chitter-challenge
$ bundle
$ rackup
Go to URL http://localhost:9292/messages
